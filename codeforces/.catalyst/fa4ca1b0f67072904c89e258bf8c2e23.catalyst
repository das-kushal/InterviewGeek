It is a complete graph: each pair of vertices is connected by an edge. The weight of each edge is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$; exactly $$$m$$$ edges have weight $$$1$$$, and all others have weight $$$0$$$.</p><p>Since Ujan doesn&apos;t really want to organize his notes, he decided to find the weight of the minimum spanning tree of the graph.
